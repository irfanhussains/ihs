                <p>The diagnostic and procedure codes are derived from medical paperwork and records, including laboratory and radiologic results, transcriptions of doctors' notes, and other data. An alphanumeric system called medical coding facilitates the development and transformation of medical diagnoses, treatments, services, and equipment. IHS's coding staff is extremely skilled, and above importantly, we have tools that allow us to complete documentation without making mistakes. </p>

                    <h2 id="scrollspyHeading3">Charge Entry</h2>
                    <p>A charge entry is a crucial and significant stage in the medical billing process that affects all parties involved greatly. </p>
                        <p>Our management staff and charge entry team collaborate well to provide reliable and on-time payments.</p>
                        <p>Additionally, it is crucial that we safeguard each stage of the charge entry process in accordance with HIPAA regulations on patient access rights, privacy, and security. </p>

                        <p> The IHS also provides a third party to the healthcare providers because it is known that claims scrubbing has always been difficult to identify and correct billing code issues. We also assist in lowering the number of claims that are refused or rejected by medical insurance.</p>
                        <p>Utilizing claim scrubbing services has the advantage of improving cash flows and ensuring fast payment of invoices. Our skilled team takes less time to correct false claims.</p>

                            <p> In the process of electronic claim submission, the claim submitted through MAC (Medicare administrative contractor) is sent to MAC electronically. Our software complies with all of the HIPAA's worldwide standards, and all claims must pass through the CMS's provider enrollment and certification criteria.</p>
                                <p>Providers are also able to bill institutional claims that are accepted for electronic submission via direct data entry (DDE). </p>

                           <h2 id="scrollspyHeading6">AR Follow up </h2>
                           <p>IHS is the industry leader in medical billing services and the most appropriate and organized organization in every process. A workforce dedicated to accounts receivable (AR) follow-up is critical to the medical billing system. Our billing specialists have a specialized skill set to handle the follow-ups on the AR.  The AR follow-up team is in charge of keeping track of refused claims and reopening them to ensure that the insurance company pays the maximum amount. </p>
                            <p>To finish the process, our AR follow team goes through three steps:</p>
                            <ul>
                            <li>initial evaluation</li>

                          <h2 id="scrollspyHeading7">Denial Management </h2>
                          <p>Denial management is a tactical procedure that aids in resolving problems with medical claim denials. The procedure also reduces the likelihood of upcoming rejections.</p>
                          <p>The IMMP process, or identity, manage, monitor, and prevent, is the responsibility of our denial management team. </p>
                          <p>The mismatch of codes is a common cause of claim denial; however, other minor flaws can also contribute to a claim being denied. </p>
                          <p>However, if your denial management staff is skilled and your system is effective, you may be able to act as a barrier to stop the technical justification of false claims.</p>

                          <p>Due to the numerous stakeholders engaged in the process to assure payments, the US medical billing procedure is quite convoluted. It appears to be a systematic process, but occasionally micromanagement mistakes put obstacles in the way of a productive process.</p>
                          <p>IHS does not cut corners with the earliest steps of medical billing in order to prevent such scenarios. Our staff takes aggressive steps to fix the mistakes.</p>
                          <p>It always assists us to create appeals for rejections and reimbursements to have good communication skills and to have records that are accurate in terms of dates and times.

                          <h2 id="scrollspyHeading9">Payment Posting </h2>
                          <p>RCM (Revenue cycle management) surrounds the US medical billing process, and payment posting is a crucial step in that process. Payment posting is the process of assessing payments and the financial standing of medical businesses. It is just as crucial for a patient as it is for any medical corporation. Our automated payment posting system aids in expediting billing for a steady stream of income.Instead of manual posting, we favor software-driven payment posting.

                          <h2 id="scrollspyHeading10">Authorization  </h2>
                          <p>Pre-Authorization and prior authorization are two distinct needs for every medical operation, particularly when it comes to surgeries or other treatments where expensive medical gadgets may be used and might be pricey for any patient. There is always a danger that claims will be denied without adequate prior permission.</p>
                            <p>When a therapy or diagnostic may not be funded by an insurance company, a prior permission is required. We always choose practice management systems, nevertheless. The American Medical Association (AMA) asserts that prior permission is problematic because it may delay or interrupt patient treatment, according to research done by its concern centers.  
                            </p>
